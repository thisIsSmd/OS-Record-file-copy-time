Write a small program that copies data from a file A to a file B. For different file sizes 1KB – 100MB 
(doubling the file size in each step) record the time your program requires to complete the copy when 
using read() and write() system calls for each byte that is being copied. Generate a graph that depicts 
the program performance. Briefly describe what you observe and investigate if you can improve the 
program’s performance. For this program it is imperative that file A and file B are located on the local 
disk. On Linux, the /tmp directory is located on the local file system. For submission, 

  a) Provide your source code in a file named copying.cpp 

  b)  Provide your graph in a file named copying.jpg 

  c) Provide your description in a file named copying.txt
